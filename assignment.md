## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```

Scrum's iterative process breaks down the project into manageable sprints, usually 1-4 weeks long, allowing the team to focus on delivering specific, incremental goals. This ensures that progress is continuous and measurable, helping the team stay aligned with the project's objectives and the school’s immediate needs.

The daily stand-ups (short, focused meetings) facilitate clear communication among team members, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding their tasks, challenges, and progress. This reduces the likelihood of miscommunication and helps the team quickly address and resolve any issues that arise.

By involving the Product Owner (who could represent the school’s administration), Scrum ensures that the IT team remains closely aligned with the school’s evolving requirements. This role helps prioritize tasks that deliver the most value to the school, such as setting up essential systems first or ensuring that security protocols are top-notch, which is crucial for an educational environment.

Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
Your answers here
- As a researcher, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can quickly find the books I’m interested in.

- As a researcher, I want to place a hold on a book that is currently checked out, so that I can borrow it when it becomes available.

- As a student, I want to see the availability status of a book, so that I know if I can borrow it immediately. 

- As a library member, I want to receive notifications when a book I’ve placed on hold becomes available, so that I don’t miss the opportunity to borrow it.

- As a student, I want to view my borrowing history, so that I can keep track of the books I’ve read.

- As a researcher, I want to extend the due date of a borrowed book, so that I can keep it longer if I need more time to read it.

- As a librarian, I want to manage the inventory of books, so that I can update the availability and details of the library’s collection.

- As a librarian, I want to view and manage user accounts, so that I can assist members with their borrowing needs.

- As a library member, I want to leave a review or rating on books I’ve borrowed, so that I can share my feedback with other members.

- As a library member, I want to receive reminders before my borrowed books are due, so that I can return or renew them on time to avoid late fees.
